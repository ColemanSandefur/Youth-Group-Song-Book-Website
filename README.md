# Song Book

## What is it?

This is a song book that was specifically created to copy an existing song book's song order and make it digital. There is a live build that you can find at [www.youthgroupsongs.com](https://youthgroupsongs.com)

## What can it do?

There are currently around ~200 songs and you can search through the songs with a search bar, which you can find in the side menu. With this search bar you can either search by title, or by song number. The search results will appear in the side menu, clicking on one of the results will automatically scroll you to the song.

## Is it possible to use this offline?

You can use this offline if you install the app by:

### Android/PC
* Go to the browser's menu
* Select install

### iOS
* Press the share button
* Select add to home screen

# Running it yourself

## Install dependencies

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed
1. Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) from the npm
1. Type `yarn` into the terminal, this will install all dependencies

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
